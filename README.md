A master's degree assignment for Spatial Analysis for Energy Data module, concerning
Indonesia solar energy development strategies through answering these following questions:

1) What is the projected electricity demand for Indonesia by 2030, and how much solar capacity
   will be provided by new solar power plants?
2) What is the solar energy development strategies?
3) Would increasing the planned share of renewable electrical power by solar power plants in
   Indonesiaâ€™s 2030 electricity capacity be a profitable investment (making money) or require a
   subsidy (losing money)? Would you recommend such a strategy even if it requires a subsidy?

Suitability analysis using criterias such as distance from protected areas, distance from 
population centers, elevation and slope of land, type of land cover, as well as distance from 
roads and electricity network were used. There are blank values for solar irradiance data used 
in this study across parts of the country, which were interpolated using spatial interpolation 
methods. 

The index were combined with solar irradiance data to provide suitable and optimal 
locations for solar plant development, which was ranked using analytic hierachy process.
